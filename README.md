# TTT Bots Lite
Very dumb and bad AI players for Trouble in Terrorist Town in Garry's Mod. The main difference between these and the regular version is the lack of pathfinding which means they will get stuck, a lot. They have a lot lighter load on the server so they might make a nice addition just for the novelty. They are not intended to replace actual players or be active participants in the match (because coding that level of intelligence would be a nightmare) but instead are passive players whose purpose is to make the server feel less empty at low player counts. Innocent bots will never attack unless they are attacked first in which case they will kill you unless you manage to get away. Traitor bots will attempt to find a weapon before going on a mass murder spree. Detective bots will buy a health station and then suicide.
